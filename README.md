# LWJGL 2D RPG

I am building a 2d game or game engine (not sure yet depends how agonising it becomes) in LWJGL (an openGL wrapper for Java). 

The only libraries I am currently using are openGL for GPU rendering, GLFW for window creation and STB for loading images in a way that can be passed to openGL.

Right now I have spritesheet loading, animation states, mouse and keyboard input and input handling and a basic actor class ready to be built on top of. Very hyped.
